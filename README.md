## Migraine Weather Tracker

This simple application tracks changes in barometric pressure and humidity in a given location to warn about weather-triggered headaches. It works by grabbing data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) and sending a email with a qualitative measure of migraine risk.
